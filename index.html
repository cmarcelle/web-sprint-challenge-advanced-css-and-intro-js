           <div class="bio">Vincent Willem van Gogh (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsɛnt ˈʋɪləm vɑŋ ˈɣɔx] (listen); 30 March 1853 – 29
               July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures
               in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around
               860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lives,
               portraits and self-portraits, and are characterized by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and
               expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. However, he was not commercially
               successful, and his suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty.</div>
